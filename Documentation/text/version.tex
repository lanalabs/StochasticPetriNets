\section*{Hints \& Version changes}

\subsubsection{Useful Hints:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Use the \emph{Configure Visibility of Transitions}-plugin to set transitions invisible, that do not appear in your log
  \item Always make sure, that your Petri nets are connected to a \textbf{final Marking}. Use the \emph{Create Final Marking Plugin} to achieve this.
  \item It is helpful to experiment with \textbf{simulated} Logs first, that \emph{fit} the Petri net. (Use CPN-Tools for example)
\end{itemize}
